# Release Policy

## Versioning

Nexa repositories version independently using Semantic Versioning. While a repository remains pre-1.0, minor versions may contain approved evolution and patch versions contain compatible fixes or documentation changes. A version applies only to the repository that publishes it.

Every release requires an annotated SSH-signed Git tag, CHANGELOG entry, versioned release notes and a GitHub Release. The tag signature must pass local verification and GitHub verification before publication. Published tags are immutable: do not retag, modify a published version, delete a release or force-push history.

## Tag signing

Release tags MUST be annotated, signed with the repository maintainer's
registered SSH signing key, verified locally with `git verify-tag <version>`
and shown as `Verified` by GitHub before publication. The private key remains
outside the repository; the committed `.github/release-allowed-signers` file
contains only the public signer identity.

## Release cadence

A merged PR is not automatically a release. Accumulate coherent changes on
`develop` until a real consumable boundary exists. Use release candidates only
when final validation needs a candidate freeze. Do not publish calendar-driven
versions or one stable release per implementation PR.

## Normalized release line

The current public line ends at `v0.12.0`. Compatible fixes use the next
patch, such as `v0.12.1`; a coherent new capability uses the next minor,
such as `v0.13.0`. Historical labels remain provenance only. Underlying
commits and signed-tag evidence remain immutable.

## Rollback and deprecations

Rollback is conceptual and depends on the consuming deployment process; it must not reuse a published tag. Breaking changes require a new compatible release line, migration notes and explicit contract impact. Deprecations require a reason, replacement guidance and a removal trigger.
