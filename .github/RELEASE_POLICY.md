# Release Policy

## Versioning

Nexa repositories version independently using Semantic Versioning. While a repository remains pre-1.0, minor versions may contain approved evolution and patch versions contain compatible fixes or documentation changes. A version applies only to the repository that publishes it.

Every release requires an annotated Git tag, CHANGELOG entry, versioned release notes and a GitHub Release. Published tags are immutable: do not retag, modify a published version or force push.

## GitFlow

```text
feature/*
    ↓
develop
    ↓
release/vX.Y.Z
    ↓
main
    ↓
annotated tag
    ↓
GitHub Release
    ↓
back-merge to develop
```

## Release cadence

A merged PR is not automatically a release. Accumulate feature and fix PRs on
`develop` while the coherent release scope is being assembled. Create a
release branch only at a real release boundary, then validate and publish one
consumable milestone. Use release candidates only when final validation needs a
candidate freeze. Do not publish calendar-driven versions or one stable
release per implementation PR.

## Rollback and deprecations

Rollback is conceptual and depends on the consuming deployment process; it must not reuse a published tag. Breaking changes require a new compatible release line, migration notes and explicit contract impact. Deprecations require a reason, replacement guidance and a removal trigger.
