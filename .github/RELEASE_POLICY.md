# Release Policy

## Versioning

Nexa repositories version independently using Semantic Versioning. While a repository remains pre-1.0, minor versions may contain approved evolution and patch versions contain compatible fixes or documentation changes. A version applies only to the repository that publishes it.

Every release requires an annotated Git tag, CHANGELOG entry, versioned release notes and a GitHub Release. Published tags are immutable: do not retag, modify a published version or force push.

## Rollback and deprecations

Rollback is conceptual and depends on the consuming deployment process; it must not reuse a published tag. Breaking changes require a new compatible release line, migration notes and explicit contract impact. Deprecations require a reason, replacement guidance and a removal trigger.
