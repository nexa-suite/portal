## Overview

Nexa Buyer Portal is the buyer-facing Angular surface for catalog discovery,
product detail, Purchase Requests, Sales Orders and buyer-safe delivery
visibility. The Portal presents buyer workflows; Nexa API owns identity,
tenant scope, pricing and business rules.

Cached state and UI authorization are advisory. Server authorization and
authoritative business responses remain decisive.

## Buyer Experiences

- Buyer access and session foundations.
- Catalog browsing and product detail.
- Purchase Request and Sales Order flows.
- Availability, loading, empty, error and retry states.
- Delivery tracking designed for buyer visibility.

Portal does not own internal administration, backend business rules or
persistence.

## Architecture Boundary

The standalone Angular application follows API-aligned feature roots under
[`src/app`](./src/app). The surface map is
[`docs/architecture/bounded-context-map.md`](./docs/architecture/bounded-context-map.md).
Presentation, application utilities and API adapters remain separated by
responsibility. Portal is not a second business authority.

## Technology Stack

| Concern | Current evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Framework | Angular 22.1.4 (locked) |
| Language | TypeScript 6.0.3 (locked), strict configuration |
| Component system | Angular Material/CDK 22.1.4 (locked) |
| State and async | Angular Signals and RxJS 7.8.2 (locked) |
| Internationalization | `@ngx-translate/core` 18.0.0 |
| Styling | SCSS |
| Package manager | npm |

## Getting Started

```bash
npm ci
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:4300` and navigate to `/home`.

## Validation

```bash
npm run validate:catalog-assets
npm run validate:design-foundations
npm run validate:architecture
npm run validate:bounded-contexts
npm test
npm run build
git diff --check
```

## Repository Structure

```text
src/app/<api-context>/       API-aligned feature roots
src/app/core/                Shell, routes and language service
src/app/shared/              Reusable presentation and application utilities
public/catalog-items/        Manifest-validated catalog media
docs/                         Architecture and releases
```

## Ownership & Boundaries

- Portal owns buyer presentation, navigation, input assistance and recovery
  states.
- API owns authentication, authorization, tenant scope, pricing, commercial
  decisions and durable state.
- Design evidence informs presentation but does not override Product or Domain
  authority.
- Cached data is not authoritative commercial truth.
