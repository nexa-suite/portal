## Overview

Angular buyer surface for Catalog discovery, product detail, Purchase Requests, Sales Orders and buyer-safe delivery tracking. Portal presents buyer workflows; API owns identity, tenant scope, pricing and business rules.

## Related repositories

The organization profile owns the full public ecosystem map. This repository links to adjacent Nexa surfaces without copying their release state.

- [Nexa API](https://github.com/nexa-suite/api) — business and integration backbone.
- [Nexa Platform](https://github.com/nexa-suite/platform) — internal operational workspace.
- [Nexa Website](https://github.com/nexa-suite/website) — public product experience.
- [Nexa Mobile](https://github.com/nexa-suite/mobile) — documentation and native runway.

## Buyer Experiences

- Buyer access and session foundations.
- Catalog browsing and product detail.
- Purchase Request and Sales Order flows.
- Availability, loading, error and retry states.
- Delivery tracking designed for buyer visibility.

Portal does not own internal administration, backend business rules or persistence.

## Architecture

Standalone Angular application. The frontend follows the canonical 11-context set as API-aligned feature roots directly under [`src/app`](./src/app/README.md); the surface map is [`docs/architecture/bounded-context-map.md`](./docs/architecture/bounded-context-map.md). Core routing, shared presentation and application utilities remain separate. Buyer-facing models and API adapters require approved contracts; Portal is not a second business authority.
