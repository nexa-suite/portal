## What is implemented

`v0.5.0` packages Angular 22 Buyer access foundations, Product Catalog discovery/detail, Request Builder, My Requests and Request Detail flows.

Portal is the buyer experience and is separate from internal Platform. This release integrates the secured Buyer IAM/session/catalog read contract with the API; broader buyer workflows, persistence beyond the API contract and production deployment are not implemented here.

The Portal link is the approved secured vertical slice for this release. Mobile is not implemented and is intentionally absent from the runtime map. PostgreSQL, AI, IoT and cloud services remain outside this frontend release.

## Repository map

| Repository | Current release | Responsibility | Evidence status |
|---|---:|---|---|
| [Website](https://github.com/nexa-suite/website) | `v1.0.0` | Static public product discovery | Released static site |
| [Platform](https://github.com/nexa-suite/platform) | `v0.5.0` | Internal operations shell | Angular 22 secured commercial surface; Docker runtime |
| **Portal** | **`v0.5.0`** | Buyer self-service shell | Angular 22 secured commercial surface; Docker runtime |
| [API](https://github.com/nexa-suite/api) | `v0.6.0` | Business and integration authority | IAM, tenant scope, Catalog and Sales requests |
| [Mobile](https://github.com/nexa-suite/mobile) | `v0.1.1` | Future native clients | Documentation-only |

## Bounded contexts

| Area | Current maturity |
|---|---|
| IAM | Secured client/API slice |
| Catalog Management | Secured read slice; shared local reference seed |
| Sales from buyer perspective | Purchase Request builder and self-service lifecycle |
| Logistics tracking | Planned |
| Invoicing documents and payments | Planned |

## Architecture

Presentation depends on Application. Application depends on Domain. Infrastructure remains outside Domain. Buyer-facing models and API adapters require an approved vertical slice and an explicit contract; Portal does not own internal administration or backend business rules.

## Tech stack

Angular 22, TypeScript strict mode, Angular Material/CDK 22, Signals, RxJS, `ngx-translate` 18, SCSS and npm 11.17.0 as declared by `package.json`.

## Getting started

```bash
npm ci
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:4300](http://localhost:4300) and navigate to `/home`.

## Available commands

```bash
npm run validate:catalog-assets
npm test
npm run build
```

## Roadmap boundary

Future buyer vertical slices require explicit contracts, buyer identity, tenant rules and runtime/browser evidence. Planned database, AI, IoT, cloud and mobile capabilities must not be described as Portal implementation until those gates pass.
